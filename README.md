## __Music Sequencer Project__

For this project, I plan on making an android music sequencer app. 

The app will mainly be coded in Java using the Android software development kit (SDK).
My intention is that the app will have 
* a record and play back feature, 
* sample songs to listen to and get ideas from, 
* a few audio channels that can play simultaneously(maybe 6 max) and 
* the ability to change the cumulative pitch of the channels.
